# PROJECT: UI/UX COMPONENTS FOR AN ARTICLE

 Design and develop drop-in components or tool that can be used to augment the standard UI and improve the overall experience of a user. You will deliver this project in two parts:

 Design and prototype the components/tools outlined (A to D)
 Develop a functional version of each component/tool designed

## Setup
 To being, using HTML and CSS, write and style a document of content that's long enough to allow the browser to scroll at least five times longer than the height of the window (approximately) when using the browser's default font size.

## Deliverables
## A) Landmarks, orientation and scroll-spy
Design a way to represent a user's progress through a long article, such that they can easily view the article's outline and move a desired portion of the document into the viewport at any time. An example of a "srollspy" (see the "Table of Contents" in a desktop browser): https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/MoritzDornseifer/iot-cloud-enabled-alarm-clock-1e5119
  - Vertical scroll bar with Raptors Logo 
  - Horizontal progress bar bouncing

## B) Carousel or tabbed component
Design a component that can guide a user though content that is split into multiple parts. The content may be controlled by the user, the component itself (a timer, perhaps), or other. The content may be of any type or medium (text content, images, videos, etc). An example of a slide deck style survey: http://thespeakerlab.typeform.com/to/mKgF8q
  - Images of game highlights
  - Twitter feed of comments from game

## C) Infinitely load content
When a user reached the bottom of a document, maintain the fluidity of the experience and engagement by loading new content. Ensure the user is made aware of new content (either upcoming, or already loading) and ensure a seamless, low-impact, responsible experience.
  - Once user reaches the bottom of the article, pop-up of upcoming article
 
## D) One component or tool of your choosing
Use your own experiences to design and develop a component or tool that will improve the experience of a user reading or viewing a website. Consider looking for inspirations on sites like Dribbble (or others) that demonstrate UI animations or related experience upgrades.
