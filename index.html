          <h2>How the Raptors Won Their First N.B.A. Championship</h2>
          <p>Here’s how the Raptors beat the Warriors in Game 6, as reported by Benjamin Hoffman in New York.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="1Quarter">
          <h4>1st Quarter</h4>
          <div class="1Quarter-1of5">
            <h5>1st Quarter: Is that really Kyle Lowry?</h5>
            <p>Kyle Lowry got off to an incredible start to the game, going on a personal 8-0 run with a layup and a pair of 3-pointers. Golden State finally got on the board when Kevon Looney drove to the basket for a dunk, but then Lowry connected again with another 3-pointer giving him 11 for the game. The veteran guard seems on a mission to get this game off to a huge start for Toronto.
            Scott Cacciola: It may come as some surprise to viewers at home that the crowd was very loud before the game, this being the N.B.A. finals and all — in addition to it being final game at Oracle Arena. But Kyle Lowry: Crafty Veteran is absolutely taking the life out of this place. It is really quiet. So soon. So suddenly.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="1Quarter-2of5">
            <h5>1st Quarter: Andre Iguodala is aggressive early.</h5>
            <p>At the first timeout the Raptors are up 17-12, having cooled off at a least a little after Kyle Lowry got them off to such an incredible start.
            Toronto is 5 of 7 from 3-point range — with two coming from Pascal Siakam who had been struggling — but Golden State is forcing its way to the basket to make up for some early 3s not falling.Maybe the most notable part of the game for Golden State’s offense is Andre Iguodala looking aggressive and Stephen Curry, so far, being quiet beyond a few free throws.Scott Cacciola: During the first timeout, they showed a tribute to Kevin Durant on the video board, featuring highlights of the injured star and audio clips from his teammates. A “K-D! K-D!” chant broke out in the crowd. Before the game, several teammates wore warm-up shirts bearing Durant’s name and number, 35.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="1Quarter-3of5">
            <h5>1st Quarter: Siakam is off to a better start this time.</h5>
            <p>Scott Cacciola: Pascal Siakam, a breakout star for Toronto in the playoffs, is coming off a quiet effort in his team’s Game 5 loss: 12 points on 6 of 15 shooting. Before tonight’s game, Coach Nick Nurse was asked about Siakam’s struggles. Nurse said he was not concerned.“I think he’s proven all playoffs long, and even all season long, that he’s a prime-time player,” Nurse said. “The other night, if you want me to be totally candid, I wasn’t happy with his defensive effort. I thought he just could have done more. He could have been more active.”
            Siakam definitely appears more active tonight, on both ends. He’s already got a couple of 3s to help the Raptors to their hot start.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="1Quarter-4of5">
            <h5>1st Quarter: Klay is in Game 6 mode.</h5>
            <p>Nick Nurse brought in Serge Ibaka and Steve Kerr countered with DeMarcus Cousins, with both teams going for some size shortly before a timeout. So far the Raptors are up 26-22, a lead that seems far too small considering how well they shot the ball early.Since the 3-pointer explosion from Kyle Lowry and Pascal Siakam, the Golden State response has been a lot of Klay Thompson. He came into the game with a reputation for big Game 6s and he has 10 points in the first quarter. Stephen Curry, meanwhile, has yet to attempt a field goal, and Kawhi Leonard has just 2 points.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="1Quarter-5of5">
            <h5>End of 1st Quarter</h5>
            <p>The Raptors led 8-0 and 11-2, but at the close of the first quarter their advantage had shrunk to 33-32 thanks to a 7-0 run by Golden State near the end of the period that included a smooth 3-point play by DeMarcus Cousins and a wide-open 3-pointer from Draymond Green.
            Kyle Lowry is definitely the story of the game so far, with 15 points after going 4 for 4 from 3-point range, but Klay Thompson has 10, Stephen Curry — after a very quiet start to the game — has 7, and Cousins, who thus far has been making an impact since coming into the game in place of Kevon Looney.
            There have already been a combined 22 3-pointers attempted in this game, with both teams trying to bury the other.

          <h4>2nd Quarter</h4>
            <div class="2Quarter-1of2">
              <h5>2nd Quarter: Paging Stephen Curry ...</h5>
              <p>The Warriors went to a big lineup, with Steph Curry out and DeMarcus Cousins and Kevon Looney both in, and while they started the second quarter well they started to fall behind thanks to Toronto’s outside shooting. With the Raptors leading, 43-38, Steve Kerr was forced to take a timeout.
                Pascal Siakam hit another 3-pointer, making him 3 of 4 in the game after a stretch coming into the game in which he’d missed 12 straight, and Fred VanVleet is continuing his streak as a great bench scorer, with two 3-pointers in nine minutes of action.
                For the Warriors to be able to score against Toronto’s terrific defense, they may not be able to have many stretches in which both Klay Thompson and Curry aren’t on the floor.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="2Quarter-2of2">
              <h5>2nd Quarter: Toronto is missing Marc Gasol.</h5>
              <p>Stephen Curry came back into the game and Golden State went on an immediate 6-0 run to take a lead, 44-43.
                The offensive push was all about Curry’s ability to move with and without the ball. He had defenders trailing him all over the court, helping set up two dunks: one by Kevon Looney, and one by Andre Iguodala on a feed from Draymond Green. Curry tossed in a little floater of his own while trying to draw a foul.
                The incredible thing for the Raptors is how tight this game is despite Kawhi Leonard having just 4 points and Marc Gasol having just 1. All of their offense has been Kyle Lowry, Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet. Leonard can explode at any time, but so far he’s just 2 of 5 from the field and appears to be getting frustrated.
                Scott Cacciola: Kawhi Leonard has had a quiet start, but the Raptors have gotten absolutely nothing from Marc Gasol, who’s missed all four of his field-goal attempts and just committed a turnover. It probably goes without saying that the Raptors can’t rely on Kyle Lowry to keep carrying them: Contributions from the likes of Gasol would be welcome.

          <h4>Third Quarter</h4>
            <div class="3Quarter-1of4">
              <h5>3rd Quarter: Suddenly, Stephen Curry is in foul trouble.</h5>
              <p>The third quarter started with both Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson missing wide-open 3-pointers, but Golden State began to find a rhythm and Andre Iguodala is heading to the foul with a chance to tie the game, with the score at 72-70 and 6:53 remaining in the period.
                The biggest developments of the quarter, in order, are Kawhi Leonard starting to assert himself offensively, Kyle Lowry picking up his fourth foul, and Stephen Curry getting up to three fouls. Curry was particularly angry about one of them, which came on what appeared to be a clean swipe of a ball from Fred VanVleet, but he’ll have to be more careful down the stretch.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="3Quarter-2of4">
              <h5>3rd Quarter: Iguodala atones.</h5>
              <p>Andre Iguodala missed both of his free throws coming out of a timeout, but the Warriors ripped off a quick 8-2 run and are suddenly leading, 78-76.
                Five of the points came from Iguodala, who hit a 3-pointer and floated one in from short-range, and the other 3 came on a 3-pointer from Klay Thompson, who is not quite Game 6 Klay tonight but who has been the Warriors’ best offensive option with 25 points so far.
                Kyle Lowry is taking a rest because of his four fouls, but Pascal Siakam is continuing to thrive on offense and has 19 points while Kawhi Leonard has not exactly lit up the place but has 15.
                </p>
            </div>
            <img src="img/game5.jpg" alt="">
            <div class="3Quarter-3of4">
              <h5>3rd Quarter: NO. NO. NO. YES!</h5>
              <p>Klay Thompson was fouled by Danny Green on a dunk attempt and immediately collapsed to the court clutching his left knee after landing awkwardly. Stephen Curry immediately slammed the ball to the court in frustration as the training staff came out to check on Thompson.
                Thompson was initially taken into the tunnel, which would have resulted in him being ineligible to return, but the wounded guard turned around and came back out for his free throws, earning an explosive ovation from the crowd at Oracle. With an injured knee he hit both of this free-throw attempts and is up to 30 points.
                The Warriors intentionally fouled to cause a break in the action so Thompson could be taken out of the game for evaluation. After all the controversy with Kevin Durant in Game 5, the team can’t afford to take any chances with another one of its stars.
                In a good sign for his overall health, Thompson was shown jogging into the locker room to be evaluated.
                Scott Cacciola: The atmosphere here was just morbid after Thompson’s exit. The crowd was trying to get some chants going, but everyone seems to be in total disbelief: Another injury? How? 
                And then, jubilation at the sight of Thompson limping back to the bench. Amazing scene.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="3Quarter-4of4">
              <h5>End of 3rd Quarter</h5>
              <p>As we head into the final fourth quarter at Oakland’s Oracle Arena, the Warriors appear to be leading, 88-86, with Kawhi Leonard’s tip-in coming just after time expired in the third.
                The Warriors closed the quarter without Klay Thompson, who was having his left knee evaluated, which allowed Toronto to break out its box-and-one defense on Stephen Curry once again. Andre Iguodala broke that defense once, hitting a 3-pointer that gave him 20 for the game, but the strategy did appear to be limiting the Warriors’ ability to move the ball.
                Thompson, who can still return because he came back from his free throws after the injury, leads all scorers with 30 points while Kyle Lowry is leading Toronto with 24.
                With the Raptors trying to come back on the road, one potential issue is foul trouble. Kawhi Leonard and Lowry have four each while no one on the Warriors has more than three.

          <h4>Fourth Quarter</h4>
          <div class="4Quarter-1of4">
            <h5>4th Quarter: The Raptors aren’t scared, and probably shouldn’t be.</h5>
            <p>The Warriors opened the fourth with a lineup of DeMarcus Cousins, Jonas Jerebko, Draymond Green, Quinn Cook and Shaun Livingston. That lineup may not have any natural shooters, but it outscored the Raptors, 3-2, in around two minutes of action.
              Once Stephen Curry was back in the game Fred VanVleet hit a 3-pointer that tied the game at 91-91 and Steve Kerr used a timeout with 8:53 remaining.
              The problem with Klay Thompson being out, beyond the loss of his shooting, is how much Toronto is able to swarm both Cousins and Curry. The Raptors do not appear scared of the other Warriors at all, and so far nothing Golden State has done given them reason to.
              </p>
          </div>
          <div class="4Quarter-2of4">
            <h5>4th Quarter: The Warriors are still in this.</h5>
            <p>The roof is coming off the Oracle as the Warriors take a 3-point lead, 97-94, on a huge dunk from Shaun Livingston.
              Fred VanVleet continues to destroy the Golden State defense with tough 3-pointers, but a combination of Draymond Green’s rebounding and the team’s unselfish play on offense has Golden State leading a game it should, by all accounts be losing.
              Green may have gotten away with offensive interference on a putback that gave him 8 points to go with his 18 rebounds, 12 assists, 2 blocks and 2 steals.
              The Warriors may not have a second shooter, but between Livingston’s midrange game, Curry’s drawing of double-teams, and Green’s passing and rebounding, they may have a chance to close their building with a win, forcing a Game 7.
              </p>
          </div>
          <div class="4Quarter-3of4">
            <h5>4th Quarter: Fred VanVleet is killing the Warriors.</h5>
            <p>Another 3-pointer from Fred VanVleet has Toronto leading 104-101 with 3:44 left in the game.
              VanVleet has simply been sensational with 12 points in the fourth quarter and 22 for the game so far.
              Stephen Curry, meanwhile, is being harassed relentlessly by Toronto and his shots aren’t falling. He missed two 3-pointers in a row after sinking a floater and if he can’t find a rhythm it will be extremely hard for the Warriors to overcome a sudden disadvantage in the game.
              </p>
          </div>
          <div class="4Quarter-4of4">
            <h5>4th Quarter: Tension.</h5>
            <p>The Raptors have the ball and lead, 109-108 with 37.7 seconds remaining.
              It’s turned into a true slugfest, with the undermanned Warriors trying to save their season at home and Toronto trying to prove its mettle.
              The scoring late in the game has come not from Kawhi Leonard or Stephen Curry but from Serge Ibaka, Pascal Siakam, Kyle Lowry, Draymond Green, and DeMarcus Cousins.
              Toronto has a clear advantage here, especially with Klay Thompson out, but the Warriors have made it a terrific game.
